#Your Morning adventure 
You choose to use your phone during class but the teacher was walking around to see if everyone is paying attention
they walk by you and noticed the bright light of your phone. The teacher sticks their hand out gesturing for you to give them the 
phone do you just give in or refuse to give your precious phone.
